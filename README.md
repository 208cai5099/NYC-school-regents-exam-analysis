# NYC-school-regents-exam-analysis

The New York State (NYS) Regents exams are assessments that test public school students' understanding of high school learning standards in English, math, science, social studies, and foreign languages. The exams are administered three times ever year: January, June, and August. Students generally must pass a certain number of Regents exams to graduate with a traditional high school diploma. Some middle schools in the state offer accelerated programs that teach the standards and enable students to earn high school credit before matriculation into high school.

In this analysis, I explore the performances of New York City (NYC) public schools on the Regents exams. The analysis starts with an overview of the performance of NYC schools, then it delves more into the differences in performance by English Language Learner (ELL) status and Students with Disability (SWD) status. The time period covered in this analysis is from 2017 to 2023 (excluding 2020 and 2021 due to COVID's impact on the exam administration). The goal is to identify interesting insights into the academic performance of students in the NYC public school system.

Here are the nain findings:

*  The city's performance on the exams in English, math, science, and social studies are medicore.
*  SWD students tend to perform worse than non-SWD students on the Regents exams.
*  ELL students tend to perform worse than their peers, while former ELL students tend to outperform everyone else.
